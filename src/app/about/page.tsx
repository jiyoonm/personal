            I’m a software engineer and creative technologist based in NYC. I’m
            currently a part of the team at Studio Elsewhere, developing
            immersive and interactive environments aimed at supporting mental
            wellness in medical settings. Our projects are specifically designed
            to offer solace to healthcare workers, aid neuroscience research in
            brain recovery, and enhance the rehabilitation experience for
            children visiting medical centers.

            I graduated with a BFA in Design and Technology and a minor in
            communication design from the Parsons School of Design. During my
            degree, I developed an interest in game design, creative coding, and
            data-driven visualizations. I also began independently studying
            Quantum Computing, obtaining a Practitioner Certificate from IBM.
